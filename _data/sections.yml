  Things to keep in mind: There is a big difference between what types of statements and actions can lead to an arrest or rough treatment and what types of statements and actions can be used against you in court.
  Law enforcement are allowed to lie to you - about anything - at all stages of interaction.
  While police are technically supposed to abide by the law and respect your rights, officers are immune from lawsuits concerning a violation of your rights unless they violate “clearly established” law. Most will go for the detention, arrest, questioning, contraband, etc when in doubt and leave it for the lawyers and judges to fight out later.
