title: One of the most important things to do post-arrest is to Shut. Your. Mouth.
---
Law enforcement may try to talk with you after you have been arrested often while promising to speak on your behalf in court or agree to reduce or withdraw your charges. These promises are often unenforceable.

It is also dangerous and inadvisable to talk to friends or family about the case against you or your charges. Doing so puts them at risk of receiveing a subpoena to testify against you should law enforcement or the prosecutor find out you were making statements not covered by attorney-client privilege. 

Even innocent statements can be turned into something that make you appear guilty, even if you are not.
