Those arrested in Pittsburgh are usually taken to [Pittbsurgh Municipal District Court](http://www.pacourts.us/courts/minor-courts/) [phone: (412) 350-6720] located at [600 First Avenue, 15219 (downtown)](https://goo.gl/maps/xhNsbQMZ2Hm) for processing and their preliminay arraignment. 

If they are not released and/or bail is not posted after their preliminary arraignment, they will be held at [Allegheny County Jail](http://www.alleghenycounty.us/jail/index.aspx) [phone: (412) 350-2000] located at [950 Second Ave, 15219 (downtown)](https://goo.gl/maps/Me197AZPrCF2). 

There is also the possibility that arrestees will be processed at various [Pittsburgh Bureau of Police zone stations](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/police/zones).

Keep in mind that in the event of mass arrests, arrestees will likely be sitting in police vans, busses, etc for several hours and will not be immediately transported to the jail or station for processing and phone calls.
