title: What if I get arrested again? Or am contacted by law enforcement?
---
Notify your attorney **immediately** if you are arrested on other charges, receive a summon in the mail, or are contacted by law enforcement. Your attorney will **not** automatically receive notice of new charges filed against you or automatically be present to represent you at your new hearing.

It also extremely important if you are contacted by law enforcement about your current charges or new charges.
