* You are **never** obligated to answer any questions.
	* The ***only*** time you are ***ever*** required to answer questions about alleged criminal activity is if you receive a subpoena to testify. This requires you to answer a ***judge's*** (or in the case of a grand jury subpeona, a prosecutor's - more on grand juries under "I received a grand jury subpoena" header.) questions, not a law enforcement agent's. 
* In Pennsylvania, you are also not required to identify yourself to law enforcement.
	* However, if you are operating a vehicle, you are required to provide your driver's license.
    * If you are in a restricted area, you may also be required to provide ID to proof your right to be there.
