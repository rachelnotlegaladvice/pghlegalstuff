- Stay calm and ask if you are being detained.
- If the answer is no, you are free to leave.
- If the answer is yes, you must stay but are not obligated to answer any - questions.
- Loudly & clearly state, "I am going to remain silent" and then remain silent - even if officers continue to speak to you.
 - Be aware that law enforcement can lie to you to coerce you into speaking.
