title: How do I post bail for someone?
---
At the preiminary arraignment, three tpes of bail may be set:
- non-monetary/personal bond,
- straight bail (full amount), or 
- bail bond ( ~10%)

Monetary bail is generally only required for those:
- with out of state addresses,
- charged with more serious crimes, such as assault, and/or
- with prior criminal records and/or active warrants.

If posted through [Allegheny County Bail Services](https://www.alleghenycourts.us/criminal/pretrial_services/bail_services/default.aspx) [phone: (412) 350- 4732] these amounts (minus filing & processing fess) are refunded at the conclusion of legal proceedings. 

Amounts paid to private bond agencies (typically 5-10% of the posted amount) are nonrefundable.

If the arrestee fails to appear at any scheduled court appearancess any bail posted to secure their release will be forfeited.

_It may still take several hours after bond is posted for a person to be processed for release, especially if a mass arrest occured_.
