If you were arrested by a police officer from a different zone, it is likely that your belongings are at your arresting officer's zone station. A list of Pittsburgh Police zone stations is available [here](http://www.pittsburghpa.gov/police/zones). 

If you were processed into Allegheny County Jail with your property, it 

can be picked up by a family member between 1:45 and 2:00pm
