title: When will they be released?
---
Generally, arrestees must be processed and appear for their preliminary arraignment within 72 hours or within “reasonable amount of time” of their arrest. Those arrested on Friday or Saturday nights typically have longer processing times than those arrested other days and times. 

Preliminary arraignments are held 24/7 at [Pittbsurgh Municipal District Court #05-0-03](http://www.pacourts.us/courts/minor-courts/) located at [600 First Avenue, 15219 (downtown)](https://goo.gl/maps/xhNsbQMZ2Hm). For arraignment info, call (412) 350-6720 and press 1. 

__Please note that the time of the preliminary arraignment is likely to be pushed back from the original estimate.__

Preliminary arraignemnts are open to the public but are often held via a closed-circuit TV system. If the arrestee is released on their own recognizance (on their word that they will comply with the terms of their release and appear at all future court appearances), they will be released immediately from the arraignment courtroom.
